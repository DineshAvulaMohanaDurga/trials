The codes are available at https://github.com/DineshAvulaMohanaDurga/Btech/tree/main/assgn%201 

\begin{itemize}
\item The code takes input from input file named "pointslist.txt" which contains the details of number of threads \textbf{nt},points \textbf{np}, the point \textbf{P} from which the distances are measured, the details of points.
\item The program creates \textbf{nt} threads and takes \textbf{np} input points from the input file.
\item Each thread handles $\frac{\textbf{np}}{\textbf{nt}}$ points and each thread finds the closest point to \textbf{P} among the points given to each thread and passes this point to the main thread.
\item The main thread finds the point that is closest to the point P among the points passed by the threads.
